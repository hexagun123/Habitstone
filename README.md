# Habitstone

#### Every step carves the stone. Make it count

## The Vision

Just as a sculptor reveals statues from marble, your habits carve greatness from raw potential. Habitstone turns discipline into legacy – one strike at a time.

## Current Features

- Create goals and track tasks.
- Carry the streak.
- Reward?
- Randomness...
- Mess around with authentication and cross platform syncing.

## Current TODO

- fix some bugs on graphs
- configure android and linux release
- Stone?
- <del>lure some beta testers</del>

## Future updates

- The stone
- Online accounts

## Try not to do

- Feed the stone to spiderwebs
